      "Learn Python from scratch: fundamentals, syntax, variables, operators, control flow, data structures, functions, modules, and packages with practical examples to build strong programming skills for real-world applications.",
    details: [
      "This Core Python course provides a thorough introduction to programming and Python, starting from the very basics. The journey begins with an overview of programming languages, their types, and paradigms, giving you a strong foundation for understanding how Python fits into the broader world of software development.",
      "You’ll then explore Python’s history, features, and real-world applications, followed by hands-on guidance for installing Python and using popular IDEs. The course covers essential language fundamentals such as keywords, identifiers, data types, and syntax, and explains the differences between Python and other languages like Java.",
      "You’ll learn to write and run Python programs in both interactive and scripting modes, including how to add comments and use different editors. Key topics include working with variables, string formatting, input/output operations, and data conversion functions.",
      "The course then delves into Python’s operators, covering arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical, bitwise, shift, membership, identity, and ternary operators, as well as operator precedence and the difference between 'is' and '=='.",
      "You’ll master control statements, including conditional statements (if, if-else, if-elif-else, nested-if), loop statements (for, while, nested loops), and branching statements (break, continue, pass, return). The course also introduces data structures, explaining sequences (strings, lists, tuples) and non-sequences (sets, frozensets, dictionaries), along with their importance and applications.",
      "Function programming is covered in detail, from defining and calling functions to understanding arguments, lambda functions, nested functions, and the use of global and non-local variables. You’ll also learn about closures, decorators, and generators.",
      "Finally, the course explores modular programming with Python modules and packages, including creating and importing modules, using module aliases, and understanding built-in module properties. You’ll learn how to organize projects into packages, the difference between packages and folders, the role of the __init__.py file, and how to use PIP for package management.",
      "By the end of this course, you’ll have a solid grasp of Python’s core concepts and be ready to build your own projects or continue to more advanced topics.",

    details: [
      "This Advanced Python course builds on the foundation of core programming by introducing powerful features and advanced topics used in real-world applications. Starting with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), students will learn how to design robust, reusable, and scalable code using classes, objects, and principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.",

      "You’ll then explore Python's robust error-handling system, including the difference between syntax and logical errors, and how to use try-except blocks to manage exceptions gracefully. The course also covers Regular Expressions in depth, teaching you how to search, match, and validate strings such as emails, phone numbers, and passwords using powerful pattern-matching techniques.",

      "File and Directory Handling introduces reading, writing, appending, and manipulating files and directories, including CSV operations and binary data handling using Python's file modes and built-in modules. The course also covers object serialization using the Pickle module, an essential tool for saving and loading Python objects.",

      "You’ll gain proficiency in working with Date and Time modules for formatting, calculating, and manipulating time-based data. Python’s calendar module is also explored, including generating text and HTML calendars.",

      "The OS module is covered to help students interact with the operating system, including file management operations like creating, renaming, and deleting files and directories, and even performing system-level actions like shutdown and restart.",

      "You’ll dive into multi-threading and multi-processing, essential for developing high-performance and concurrent applications. Topics include thread life cycles, creating single and multi-threaded applications, and utilizing multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.",

      "Garbage Collection concepts are introduced to help manage memory more efficiently, including the use of Python’s built-in `gc` module and understanding self-referencing object cleanup.",

      "The course also introduces Python Database Communication (PDBC) with MySQL, enabling students to connect Python applications to a database, perform CRUD operations, and understand the differences between file-based and DBMS storage.",

      "Network Programming with sockets gives learners a solid understanding of how client-server communication works. Students will learn to build basic socket-based programs using Python's socket module.",

      "In the GUI Programming section, the course explores Tkinter for building desktop applications and the Turtle module for graphics. Students will build interfaces using labels, buttons, text boxes, menus, and layout managers while handling events and setting widget properties.",

      "By the end of this Advanced Python course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and hands-on experience required to build desktop applications, interact with databases and networks, and manage system-level operations—skills that are essential for real-world software development and job readiness.",
